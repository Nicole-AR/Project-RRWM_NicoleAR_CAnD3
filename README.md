# Project-RRWM_NicoleAR_CAnD3
CAnD3 assignement for Research Replicability and Workflow Management (RRWM)

As part of a CAnD3 assignment from the Research Replicability and Workflow Management (RRWM) module, I created this Github repository.  

In this exercise I am trying to answer the following research question:                                                                                  
How does the region of origin influence the educational attainment of immigrants, controlling for sex, province of residence, and age at immigration? 

There are five documents in this repository:
